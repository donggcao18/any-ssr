## Environment
We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) to install the development environment.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ZHUANGHP/Any-SSR.git

cd Any-SSR
conda env create -n anyssr-olora
conda activate anyssr-olora
pip install -r requirements.txt

FLASH_ATTENTION_SKIP_CUDA_BUILD=TRUE pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1 --no-build-isolation


```
## Quick Start

### Lora Model Training

You can use
```bash
bash train_lora.sh
```
to train a lora model for each task in the Trace dataset.
